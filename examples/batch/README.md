## PostgreSQL Batch Example in Go

This example is subdivided into three steps.
1. databaseSetup
2. requestBatch, where a list of sql queries is executed.
3. databaseCleanup

**Description:**

This Go program demonstrates interacting with a PostgreSQL database using batch operations for improved efficiency. It leverages the `pgx/v5` library for database connectivity.

**Features:**

- **Database Setup:** Creates a table named `ledger` to store data (description and amount).
- **Batch Requests:** Executes multiple SQL statements within a single database transaction using `pgx.Batch`. This includes inserts (`INSERT`), selects (`SELECT`), and an aggregate function (`SUM`).
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles potential errors during database operations and panics for critical failures.
- **Transaction Management:** Ensures data consistency by using transactions with `Begin`, `Commit`, and `Rollback`.
- **Cleanup:** Deletes all rows from the `ledger` table after processing.

**Requirements:**

- Go programming language installed (`https://golang.org/doc/install`)
- PostgreSQL database server running
- `pgx/v5` library (`go get -u github.com/jackc/pgx/v5`)

**Instructions:**

1. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - Replace placeholders in the `pgxpool.New` connection string with your actual database credentials (`<rolename>`, `<password>`, `<hostname>`, and `<database>`).
2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the Go program using `go run .` from the terminal.

**Note:**

- This example is for demonstration purposes and might require adjustments for production use cases.
- Consider implementing proper configuration management for database credentials.

**Additional Information:**

- Refer to the `pgx/v5` documentation for detailed API usage: [https://github.com/jackc/pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)

**Disclaimer:**

- This example assumes a basic understanding of Go and PostgreSQL.
